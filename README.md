# Secure Multi Party Computation
This repository contains presentations that I prepared during my research intern at Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan.

The aim of research was to study the field of Secure Multi-Party Computations (SMC), explore a practical SMC framework ObliVM and demonstrate business use case for the same. White paper on ObliVM can be found here : http://www.cs.umd.edu/~elaine/docs/oblivm.pdf

Hope this helps someone researching in the same area.
